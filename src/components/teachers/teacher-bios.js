      "I am a native Mandarin Chinese speaker. I've been tutoring Chinese for over 5 years. I have students from 4 years old to 60 years old. I think the journey of learning Chinese should be fun and enjoyable and I tried my best to make every one of my lessons that way. I can help you learn Chinese for traveling, business, academic studying or as a hobby.\nMy teaching philosophy is to learn a new language along with the cultural connotation behind that language. Every Mandarin Chinese learner should know some extent of Chinese culture not only for the sake of accumulating their knowledge bank but also for helping memorize the vocabularies and expressions faster and longer.\nMy specialty is teaching the Chinese language and Chinese culture at the same time. China is a great country with 5000 years of history and more importantly, it is one of the fastest developing countries in the world. I will not only help you with speaking, listening, reading and writing, but also, I can tell you various updated stories about China. Meanwhile, I will also tell you interesting anecdotes of Chinese idioms, slangs, and ancient stories so that it makes the learning process more accessible and memorable. You can learn more and faster with me beyond textbooks.\nI am willing to tailor the teaching methods and learning materials individually depends on your needs. I like to provide individual attention to each student because everyone's learning style is different. You can ask any questions regarding our lessons during the class.",
