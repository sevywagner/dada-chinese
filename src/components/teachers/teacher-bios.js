      "I am a native Mandarin Chinese speaker, and I've been tutoring Chinese for over five years. I teach a broad age range starting at age four and ending at 60. I think the journey of learning Chinese should be intriguing and enjoyable, and I have made it my mission to make every one of my lessons just that. I can help you learn Chinese for traveling, business, academic studying, or even as a hobby. My teaching philosophy is to learn a new language along with the cultural connotation behind that language. Every Mandarin Chinese learner should have, at the very least, foundational knowledge of Chinese culture, not purely for the sake of knowing but also for aiding the process of memorizing vocabulary and expressions. My specialty is teaching the Chinese language and Chinese culture at the same time. China is one of the fastest-developing countries in the world, with over 5000 years of history and cultural development. I will teach you speaking, listening, reading, and writing, as well as keep you up-to-date with Chinese idioms, slang, and various folklore, to increase the memorability of the lesson. You can learn more content faster with me than with textbooks because I tailor the teaching methods and learning materials to the student's needs. I like to provide individual attention to each student because everyone learns differently. I welcome all questions regarding the language, culture, and otherwise. ",
