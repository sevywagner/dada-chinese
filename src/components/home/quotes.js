        quote: 'I have had many Chinese tutors but none like JingYi. She does an amazing job thoroughly explaining the grammar concepts that are hard to understand when your first language doesnâ€™t have them. I also appreciate how she shares different parts of Chinese culture, various folklore, songs, etc. She is very in depth and engaging and happy to answer any questions you might have. If you are looking to study Chinese I highly recommend Dada Chinese.',
