        quote: 'I have had many Chinese tutors but none like JingYi. She does an amazing job thoroughly explaining the grammar concepts that are hard to understand when your first language doesn’t have them. I also appreciate how she shares different parts of Chinese culture, various folklore, songs, etc. She is very in depth and engaging and happy to answer any questions you might have. If you are looking to study Chinese I highly recommend Dada Chinese.',

        quote: 'I’ve been learning Chinese from Jingyi for exactly 1 year now and she’s the best tutor I could ask for!! Her lessons are always well structured and she’s great at explaining difficult grammar concepts. Usually, we’ll start by going through a power point presentation of the new vocab and grammar points with lots of pictures, review with the textbook, practice reading a dialogue, and then at the end we’ll read an article or watch a video about Chinese culture. She’s so patient with me when I can’t remember characters or words very well (which is quite often) and she is so so kind. She’s very knowledgeable and always has a good answer for my random questions about China. I usually dread when it’s time to take my language classes but never with Jingyi!! If you’re on the fence this is your sign to learn Chinese from her!! I promise you won’t regret it',

        quote: 'Jingyi is simply awesome and I am very lucky to have stumbled across her in my search for a Mandarin tutor. In preparation for a trip to China, i am using software, books, immersion and Jingyi to learn all that I can. Jingyi is patient, flexible, kind and feichung knowledgable on all things China. She is also punctual and very understanding ... willing to go off on a tangent if that\'s where I decide to go (example ... cultural differences). In short, Jingyi should be your first choice if you want to learn Chinese!',
